  "few_shot_examples": "## Few-Shot Examples\n\n### Example 1: High Confidence Work Fact\n**Conversation:**\n[2024-01-15T10:23:00] Alice (ID: 12345): Just finished my first week at Google! Working as a SWE in the Cloud team\n[2024-01-15T10:24:30] Bob (ID: 67890): Congrats! How's the SF office?\n[2024-01-15T10:25:12] Alice (ID: 12345): It's great! Love the campus\n\n**Extraction:**\n```json\n{\n  \"facts\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"WORKS_AT\",\n      \"subject_id\": \"12345\",\n      \"object_label\": \"Google\",\n      \"attributes\": {\n        \"organization\": \"Google\",\n        \"role\": \"Software Engineer\",\n        \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n      },\n      \"confidence\": 0.95,\n      \"evidence\": [\"msg_001\", \"msg_003\"],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-15T10:23:00Z\",\n      \"notes\": \"Explicitly stated current employment with role and location confirmed in context\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Why high confidence (0.95)?** Alice directly states she works at Google, mentions her role, and confirms SF location. This is a primary source statement.\n\n---\n\n### Example 2: Medium Confidence Location Inference\n**Conversation:**\n[2024-02-01T14:00:00] Carol (ID: 11111): Anyone near downtown want to grab lunch?\n[2024-02-01T14:01:00] Dave (ID: 22222): I'm in SoMa, where you thinking?\n[2024-02-01T14:02:00] Carol (ID: 11111): How about that new place on Market St?\n\n**Extraction:**\n```json\n{\n  \"facts\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"LIVES_IN\",\n      \"subject_id\": \"22222\",\n      \"object_label\": \"San Francisco\",\n      \"attributes\": {\n        \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n      },\n      \"confidence\": 0.70,\n      \"evidence\": [\"msg_002\"],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2024-02-01T14:01:00Z\",\n      \"notes\": \"Implied by being in SoMa neighborhood; likely resident but could be visiting\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Why medium confidence (0.70)?** Dave is in SoMa (San Francisco neighborhood) but this could mean he's visiting, works there, or lives there. The inference is reasonable but not certain.\n\n---\n\n### Example 3: Topic Interest\n**Conversation:**\n[2024-03-10T16:00:00] Eve (ID: 33333): Been diving deep into Rust lately\n[2024-03-10T16:01:00] Eve (ID: 33333): The ownership model is fascinating\n[2024-03-10T16:02:00] Frank (ID: 44444): Same! I've been reading the async book\n[2024-03-10T16:03:00] Eve (ID: 33333): Oh nice, I haven't gotten to async yet\n\n**Extraction:**\n```json\n{\n  \"facts\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"TALKS_ABOUT\",\n      \"subject_id\": \"33333\",\n      \"object_label\": \"Rust Programming\",\n      \"attributes\": {\n        \"topic\": \"Rust Programming\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      \"confidence\": 0.85,\n      \"evidence\": [\"msg_001\", \"msg_002\", \"msg_004\"],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-10T16:00:00Z\",\n      \"notes\": \"Multiple messages showing active interest and learning\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"TALKS_ABOUT\",\n      \"subject_id\": \"44444\",\n      \"object_label\": \"Rust Programming\",\n      \"attributes\": {\n        \"topic\": \"Rust Programming\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      \"confidence\": 0.80,\n      \"evidence\": [\"msg_003\"],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-10T16:02:00Z\",\n      \"notes\": \"Single message but shows active engagement with advanced topic (async)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example 4: DO NOT EXTRACT - Speculation\n**Conversation:**\n[2024-04-01T09:00:00] Grace (ID: 55555): Thinking about applying to Amazon\n[2024-04-01T09:01:00] Henry (ID: 66666): You should! I heard they're hiring\n[2024-04-01T09:02:00] Grace (ID: 55555): Yeah, might send in my resume next week\n\n**Extraction:**\n```json\n{\n  \"facts\": []\n}\n```\n\n**Why no extraction?** Grace is considering applying (speculation), not stating current employment. \"Thinking about\" and \"might\" indicate future possibility, not present fact.\n\n---\n\n### Example 5: DO NOT EXTRACT - Hypothetical\n**Conversation:**\n[2024-05-01T12:00:00] Iris (ID: 77777): If I worked at Meta, I'd probably be on the Reality Labs team\n[2024-05-01T12:01:00] Jack (ID: 88888): lol that would be cool\n\n**Extraction:**\n```json\n{\n  \"facts\": []\n}\n```\n\n**Why no extraction?** \"If I worked at\" is explicitly hypothetical. Iris is not stating current employment.\n\n---\n\n### Example 6: DO NOT EXTRACT - Joking/Sarcasm\n**Conversation:**\n[2024-06-01T15:00:00] Kate (ID: 99999): Ugh I'm basically living at the office these days\n[2024-06-01T15:01:00] Leo (ID: 10101): Same, I should just move into the conference room lol\n\n**Extraction:**\n```json\n{\n  \"facts\": []\n}\n```\n\n**Why no extraction?** These are hyperbolic expressions of being busy, not literal statements about residence. The \"lol\" and context indicate non-literal meaning.\n\n---\n\n### Example 7: Relationship Closeness\n**Conversation:**\n[2024-07-01T18:00:00] Mike (ID: 20202): @Nina (ID: 30303) want to grab dinner after work?\n[2024-07-01T18:01:00] Nina (ID: 30303): Sure! Our usual spot?\n[2024-07-01T18:02:00] Mike (ID: 20202): Yeah, see you at 7\n[2024-07-01T18:30:00] Oscar (ID: 40404): You two are always hanging out lol\n\n**Extraction:**\n```json\n{\n  \"facts\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"CLOSE_TO\",\n      \"subject_id\": \"20202\",\n      \"object_id\": \"30303\",\n      \"attributes\": {\n        \"closeness_basis\": \"Regular social activities together, noted by others\"\n      },\n      \"confidence\": 0.75,\n      \"evidence\": [\"msg_001\", \"msg_002\", \"msg_004\"],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2024-07-01T18:00:00Z\",\n      \"notes\": \"Pattern of regular interaction confirmed by third party observation\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Why extract?** Multiple signals: they have a \"usual spot\", Oscar comments on frequent hangouts. This suggests a genuine social relationship beyond casual interaction.",
  "confidence_guidelines": "## Confidence Scoring Guidelines\n\nScore facts on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale based on these criteria:\n\n### 0.90 - 1.00: Very High Confidence\n- Primary source: Person directly states fact about themselves\n- Explicit and specific: Clear, unambiguous language\n- Recently confirmed: Stated in present tense or very recent past\n- Example: \"I work at Google as a software engineer\"\n\n### 0.75 - 0.89: High Confidence\n- Strong implication: Context makes fact very likely\n- Confirmed by multiple sources: Multiple people corroborate\n- Specific details present: Includes verifiable specifics\n- Example: \"Started my new role at Microsoft last month\"\n\n### 0.60 - 0.74: Moderate-High Confidence\n- Reasonable inference: Logical conclusion from context\n- Single strong indicator: One clear signal with good context\n- Recent but not explicit: Implied from recent conversation\n- Example: \"Been working with the AWS team on this\"\n\n### 0.50 - 0.59: Moderate Confidence\n- Weak implication: Possible but not certain\n- Limited context: Not enough information to be sure\n- Temporal ambiguity: Unclear if current or past\n- Example: \"Love the SF weather\" (might live there, might be visiting)\n\n### 0.30 - 0.49: Low Confidence\n- Speculative inference: Requires assumptions\n- Ambiguous language: Could mean multiple things\n- Minimal evidence: Only one weak signal\n- Generally avoid extracting below 0.5 unless particularly valuable\n\n### Below 0.30: Do Not Extract\n- Too speculative\n- Insufficient evidence\n- High chance of being wrong\n\n### Special Modifiers\n- Reduce confidence by 0.1-0.2 if indirect statements, hedges, ambiguity, or unclear time references\n- Increase confidence by 0.1 if corroborated, recent, specific, and uncontested\n\n### Never Extract If\n- Explicitly hypothetical (\"if\", \"would\", \"could\")\n- Clearly joking (sarcasm indicators, \"lol\", absurd content)\n- About future intent only (\"going to\", \"planning to\")\n- Question rather than statement\n- Negation (\"I don't work at...\")",
  "edge_case_guidance": "## Edge Case Handling\n\n### Past vs. Present Employment\n- Do NOT extract \"I used to work at Google\"\n- Do NOT extract \"I worked at Google for 5 years\"\n- Extract \"I've been at Google for 5 years\"\n- Extract \"Just celebrated my 5 year anniversary at Google\"\n\n### Company Transitions\n- Extract \"Starting at Amazon next week\" (note future start, lower confidence)\n- Extract \"Last day at Google tomorrow, starting Meta on Monday\" with start/end dates\n\n### Multiple Roles\n- Extract both roles when someone works multiple jobs; annotate primary vs. secondary if stated\n\n### Ambiguous Locations\n- Do NOT extract \"Love visiting SF\"\n- Extract \"Moved to SF last month\"\n- Extract \"SF native\" with high confidence\n- Consider low confidence if simply \"In SF this week\"\n\n### Company Name Variations\n- Normalize names (e.g., \"GOOG\" → \"Google\", \"Microsoft Corp\" → \"Microsoft\")\n\n### Pronouns and References\n- Track context for pronouns and \"the company\" references; skip if unclear\n\n### Negative Statements\n- Do NOT extract \"I don't work at Google anymore\" as current employment; optionally mark end date\n\n### Questions vs Statements\n- Do NOT extract questions or speculation; only extract affirmative answers"
